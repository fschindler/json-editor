# Object Properties

> _json-schema_ has a set of definitions for object properties. This section details how those definitions transfer to a user interface build with _@sagold/react-json-editor_ and its default widgets.

Validation of data is fully supported, the following list tracks support of the user interface:

| Status | Feature                                        | Comments                                                                  |
| :----: | :--------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   ✅   | [properties](#properties)                      |
|   ✅   | [required](#required-properties)               | per default, only required properties will be added                       |

## Properties

Per default, missing properties will only be added when they are required. Optional properties having a schema definition can be added dynamically:

<Canvas className="inline" of={ObjectProperties.OptionalProperties} />

Optional properties containing data from input will be added automatically:

<Canvas className="inline" of={ObjectProperties.InitialOptionalProperty} />

You can change this behaviour to add optional properties initially by passing

<Canvas className="inline" of={ObjectProperties.AddOptionalProps} />

## Required Properties

With a property set as required, it will always be available in the form:

<Canvas className="inline" of={ObjectProperties.RequiredProperties} />

## Additional Properties

Additional properties that are not defined within json-schema will be shown by default and may be removed:

<Canvas className="inline" of={ObjectProperties.AdditionalProperties} />

If you set additionalProperties to false, any additional data will be removed from user form and exported data:

<Canvas className="inline" of={ObjectProperties.AdditionalPropertiesFalse} />

Using additionalProperties with a json-schema, will apply this schema to any unknown property:

<Canvas className="inline" of={ObjectProperties.AdditionalPropertiesSchema} />

> _Note_ Currently no user interface is offered to add additional data. You can enable the `editJson` option to allow users to add additional properties as json or you can create a custom object widget that supports this.

Example Object with **editJson** option

<Canvas className="inline" of={ObjectProperties.EditJson} />

## One Of

json-schema containing an oneOf statement will show a selection to choose the sub schema:

<Canvas className="inline" of={ObjectProperties.OneOfObject} />

Note that json-schema requires distinguishable json-schema. If there is an undistinguishable schema (same validation results) the user interface will not behave correctly:

<div className="code code--inline">
```ts
// invalid oneOf-schema
{
  oneOf: [
    { required: ['one'], one: { type: 'string '},
    { required: ['one'], one: { type: 'string '}
  }]
}
```
</div>

<Canvas className="inline" of={ObjectProperties.InvalidOneOfObject} />

To ensure _oneOf_ schemas can be distinguished it is recommended to add a unique property:

<div className="code code--inline">
```ts
// valid oneOf-schema
{
  oneOf: [
    { required: ['id', 'one'], id: { type: "string", const: "A" }, one: { type: 'string '},
    { required: ['id', 'one'], id: { type: "string", const: "B" },  one: { type: 'string '}
  }]
}
```
</div>

<Canvas className="inline" of={ObjectProperties.TypedOneOfObject} />

> _Note_ You can set `{ options: { hidden: true }}` to each property _id_ to hide the control variable from user interface. Still, _id_ will be exported in data.

In case you want a selection to always be associated with the selected schema, identified by an _id_, it his highly recommended tp use the additional flag `oneOfProperty`. This will always select the corresponding schema, regardless of additional validation errors. So for the above example we add

```ts
{
  oneOfProperty: 'id', // identify subschema be the property 'id'
  oneOf: { ... }
}
```

<Canvas className="inline" of={ObjectProperties.OneOfProperty} />

As you can see, the selected schema is always associated with **B** although there are validation errors. This is the expected behaviour.

## All Of

_allOf_ requires all sub schemas to be valid for the given input. For a user input this all sub schemas have to be merged, thus you must ensure properties and validation rules are exclusive. At some point, the merging of subschemas might improve here, but currently any attributes woud be overriden by the last definition.

The following example has conflicting validation rules, where the last statement will be applied:

<Canvas className="inline" of={ObjectProperties.AllOf} />

_allOf_ also supports any json-schema supported by json-editor, e.g. if-then-else statements

> **⚠️ TODO** change in schema should not lose focus

<Canvas className="inline" of={ObjectProperties.AllOfIfThen} />

## dependencies

`dependencies: { prop: ['prop'] }`

Dependencies are not added per default

<Canvas className="inline" of={ObjectProperties.DependenciesList} />

Dependencies are added when they are required by another property which has been set (`!== undefined`)

<Canvas className="inline" of={ObjectProperties.DependenciesListActive} />

`dependencies: { prop: { schema } }`

Dependent schemas are not added per default for a missing dependent property

<Canvas className="inline" of={ObjectProperties.Dependencies} />

Dependent schemas are added if the dependent property is set (`!== undefined`)

<Canvas className="inline" of={ObjectProperties.DependenciesActive} />

## if-then-else

_if-then_ statement, adding or removing a schema with its data depending on the property of trigger. The following toggle should not show the property per default as the property `addition` is not set as required

<Canvas className="inline" of={ObjectProperties.IfThenElse} />

Same setup as above, but with property `addition` set as required:

<Canvas className="inline" of={ObjectProperties.IfThenElseActive} />

> If you want to persist the value entered independent of the current visbility, follow the [tutorial](?path=/story/examples-jsonschemasupport--all-of-with-conditions).

_if-then-else_ statement used to switch sub-schemas

<Canvas className="inline" of={ObjectProperties.IfThenElseSwitch} />
