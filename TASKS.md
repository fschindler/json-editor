## headless-json-editor

- [maybe] replace inline changes by diff-helper
- [✓] history plugin
- [ ] improve plugin interface for outside instance creation & interaction

## react-json-editor

- [ ] copy & pase object and array data 
    - unfortunately access to clipboard via an action is prevented by firefox
    - this requires a json-editor to let the user copy and paste (instead of button actions)
- [✓] collapsable objects and arrays
